The <strong>sentiment score</strong> measures a combination of three aspects of language: valence (degree of positive connotation), arousal (degree of intensity), and dominance (degree of control). A word like 'terror' would have a low score for positive valence, a high arousal score, and a low dominance score. A word like 'laughter' would have a high positive valence score, a fairly high score of intensity, and a medium score for control. The scores come from a dictionary of over 20,000+ English words and scores that have been created by a group of human raters. The scores are first computed for each word, then averaged for each line, then averaged across a whole chapter. Because the scores don't account for context, they can sometimes be way off.  </p><p>This visualization doesn&apos;t contain stop words.

All words are converted to lowercase first.</p><p></p><p>- <strong>Agent Verb</strong>: Actions where a character is the doer or the instigator of an action specified by the verb. For example, if a character named John is &quot;running,&quot; then John is the agent of the action &quot;running.&quot; The identification of agent verbs helps in understanding which characters are driving the narrative forward through their actions.</p><p>- <strong>Patient Verb</strong>: Actions where a character is the recipient or the target of an action. For instance, if John is &quot;hit&quot; by a ball, John is the patient in this context because he is receiving the action of being hit. Patient verbs are useful for analyzing how characters are affected by the actions of others or by events in the story.</p><p>- <strong>Possession Verb</strong>: Verbs related to the ownership or possession of objects or entities by characters in the narrative. For example, if John &quot;owns&quot; a house, the verb &quot;owns&quot; signifies John&apos;s possession of the house.

The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon includes a list of more than 20,000 English words and their valence, arousal, and dominance scores. These scores represent how a word could contribute to the suspense of a sentence.

The <strong>sentiment score</strong> measures a combination of three aspects of language: valence (degree of positive connotation), arousal (degree of intensity), and dominance (degree of control). A word like 'terror' would have a low score for positive valence, a high arousal score, and a low dominance score. A word like 'laughter' would have a high positive valence score, a fairly high score of intensity, and a medium score for control. The scores come from a dictionary of over 20,000+ English words and scores that have been created by a group of human raters. The scores are first computed for each word, then averaged for each line, then averaged across a whole chapter. Because the scores don't account for context, they can sometimes be way off.  </p><p>This visualization doesn&apos;t contain stop words.
